            distracted by the readable content of a page when 
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
            is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here',

            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their 
            default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will 
            uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various
